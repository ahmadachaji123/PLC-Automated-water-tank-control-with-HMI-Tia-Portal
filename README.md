This project presents a Water Tank Level Control System developed using PLC and HMI technology, designed to enhance skills in handling analog inputs/outputs, secure user interfaces, and safety automation logic.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Manual & Auto Modes: Manual control of pump/valve with safety interlocks. Auto mode automates filling/draining based on high/low water levels.

HMI with Password Protection: Users access variable settings through a secure login, which automatically logs out after 1 minute of inactivity.

System Variables: Adjustable parameters for water level thresholds and delay timers for pump and valve activation.

Mode Switching Logic: Switching between manual and auto triggers a full system reset, ensuring clean transitions.

Timers for Flow Stabilization: Prevents false triggers due to fluctuating water levels during mode changes.

Advanced Safety: Includes protection against illogical input (e.g., conflicting level settings), range checking (0â€“60), error states with LED indicators, and priority-based input handling.

Alarm System: LED alarms indicate critical water levels and configuration errors.

This project is ideal for learners and engineers interested in advanced water level management, analog signal processing, and secure HMI integration in industrial automation environments.
